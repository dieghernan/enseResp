`enseResp` is a R package to tidily access healthcare data from the Spanish Health Survey released by the Spanish Health Ministry. The main goal of `enseResp` is to provide data ready for analysis for researchers or other stakeholders interested in exploring health microdata in Spain. The current version of `enseResp` consists of the survey corresponding to 2017/19 and compiles the surveys associated with the adult, children and household samples.
