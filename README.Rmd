`enseResp` is a R package to tidily access healthcare data from the Spanish Health Survey released by the Spanish Health Ministry. The main goal of `enseResp` is to provide data ready for analysis for researchers or other stakeholders interested in exploring health microdata in Spain. The current version of `enseResp` consists of the survey corresponding to 2017/19 and compiles the surveys associated with the adult, children and household samples.


## Installation

You can install the devlopment version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edugonzaloalmorox/enseResp")
```
## Load main datasets

This is a basic example of how to obtain a dataset. For example, the survey of adults corresponding to 2017-19 survey. 

```{r adults}
library(enseResp)
library(dplyr)


enseResp::adults_19
```

## Variables information


`adults_19` contains 455 variables. `adults_19_info` provides information about the description of every variable (in Spanish). In addition it offers other information such as the type of variable, the positions in the text archive or the module the variable belongs to (for example, European Health Survey)

```{r adults_info, message= FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(enseResp)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

enseResp::adults_19_info %>% 
  select(variable_ine, descripcion_del_campo) %>% 
  head(10) %>% kable()
```

## Variables values


`enseResp` also provides information on the values for each variable. This is given by the `labels` datasets. `adults_19_labels` renders information on the values associated with the variables that compose `adults_19`. For example, lets check the values in the level of physical activity (variable `T111`)

```{r adults_labels}
library(enseResp)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

enseResp::adults_19_labels %>% 
  filter(variable_ine == "T111") %>%
 kable()
```
